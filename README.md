## üí° Inspiration
In the life of every modern person, there are everywhere subscriptions and recurrent payments. Whether it's an Apple Music subscription, a gym membership, utility bills, transfers to parents, charity, Netflix, etc., everyone deals with it in one way or another.

Most popular variant of the subscriptions is a following someone in social medias such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, Twitter, Medium, LinkedIn, etc. or visit favorite website blog on regular base. Although in the last case, most likely you did not press the subscribe button, but you signed up for it behind the scenes.

All these authors have a direct or indirect influence on our lives. They enlighten, teach, amuse, inspire us... Some platforms and websites have functional to create a paid subscription or ways to say thanks for that in other ways. But most don't have that option or the conditions are not quite suitable for us, for example some services offer sponsorship with $4.99. To say truly most people don't ready to support one author with $4.99 each month also there may be many of these authors so if you count, it turns out not at all cheap. But what if there was a way to support the author, for example with $0.1 or even with $0.01. Is it a lot for the opportunity to thank and the feeling of belonging...?¬†

So we have subscriptions everywhere in one form or another, and the imperfect work of subscription systems in platforms and websites.

As a result, the task of the Subnear is to give a way to subscribe to anything and manage it all in one place. Ordinary users will be able to create any subscriptions, for any directions, with any amounts and schedules. Creators will be able to expand the functionality of standard platforms and websites and allow people to sign up for more efficient and convenient subscriptions.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è What it does
- **Subscriptions & Recurring Payments**
<br>_Create, manage and edit subscriptions and recurrent payments in a few clicks._
<br>The app has a nice and simple interface in which users can create a fully customized subscriptions. They can see a list of their subscriptions, open details of any necessary of them, pause, edit or delete them. Base on this functional are working other parts of the app.
- **Website Integration**
<br>_Allow your website readers to support you with a paid subscription._ 
<br>You need to include the special HTML code before the closing ```</body>``` HTML-tag and then if users with the Subnear extension will open your website they will see subscribe button. If they click on it, a window for creating a subscription will open. All the main fields such as name, wallet, etc., will be automatically filled in. Users will need to specify only the amount of NEAR and if wish to change something in the other fields. After users have filled in the fields and clicked subscribe, you will receive recurring payments according to the schedule. Also you can customize the button as you want, and you can check user subscription status and for example show additional content, hide ads, open access to premium functional, etc.
- **Social Media Integration**

## üë®‚Äçüíª How I built it
- **HTML, CSS and JS** for the frontend part.
- **Chrome APIs** for communications between the extension parts.
- **NEAR API JS** to connect with NEAR.

## ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Challenges I ran into
- **Learning Web3 and Blockchain**
<br>It was my first introduction to Web3 world, and I had to learn the fundamental concepts and principles.
- **Developing with NEAR**
<br>I figured out the NEAR ecosystem, its possibilities for developers and learned how to integrate NEAR API JS.
- **Building Chrome browser extensions**
<br>The best way to realize my idea I saw in a browser extension, and I was needed to learn how to build it.

## üíú Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Despite the complete lack of experience and knowledge in the blockchain, I managed to figure it all out. 

I was also able to come up with an idea that fits perfectly with the concept of the blockchain and the possibility of NEAR. It is able to solve the problem of the real world, help real ordinary people, not just narrowly focused specialists, work in our time, and not in a non-existent future. This idea really fired me up, and I developed a user-friendly MVP, design and positioning. 

But the coolest thing is ahead, a lot of ideas come up on how to develop, promote and expand the product...

## ü¶Ñ What's next for Subnear

<br> It will be an informative landing page or business card website with all the information, links, etc. Users will be able to authorize to their admin panels where they can in a more detailed way manage their subscriptions and subscribers, see stats, analyze and work with the functional I'm describing next.
- **Social media integrations without usage of the ‚Äúspecial line‚Äù method**
